# Development guide

Use [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md#authority-and-ownership) for repository ownership
and architecture boundaries, and [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) to select checks.
This guide covers building and running the real Machine–Broker–Signer triad.
The developer profile shares a login; it preserves custody and protocol
boundaries but does not prove production principal isolation.

For the bounded mounted passkey workflow, see
[Local mainnet integration](./docs/local-mainnet-integration.md).

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| [Rust via rustup](./rust-toolchain.toml) | Workspace builds and tests |
| Foundry (`anvil`, `cast`, `forge`) | Local EVM integration tests |
| `jq` | Developer harnesses and shell tests |
| Agave `solana-test-validator` v3.0.0 | Optional validator-backed Solana tests |
| Docker | Optional Linux and Anvil environments |
| macOS NFS client | Mounted-VFS tests on macOS |
| Tart | macOS packaging and principal-isolation acceptance |

Run builds from the repository checkout so rustup uses the toolchain selected
by `rust-toolchain.toml` (currently stable). The workspace manifest declares
Rust 1.86 as its minimum version; this is separate from the selected
development toolchain.

Keep the three repositories side by side by default:

```text
work/
├── bloom/
├── bloom-broker/
└── bloom-signer/
```

The launcher copies a canonical Machine config into its isolated developer
home. Create that config once before the first launch:

```sh
cargo run -p bloom -- init
```

To use a candidate-specific config instead, set
`BLOOM_TRIAD_DEV_MACHINE_CONFIG` to a regular, non-symlink file. Never point
`--machine-home` at the canonical `~/.bloom`; the launcher requires Machine
state to live inside the selected developer root.

Keep optional RPC endpoints and API keys in ignored local configuration.
Wallet secret input stays in the Broker-hosted ceremony; use only disposable
test inputs with the acceptance harnesses.

## Building

Common Machine builds are:

```sh
# Normal developer build, including the mount adapter.
cargo build -p bloom

# Portable production-shaped Machine.
cargo build -p bloom --no-default-features

# Explicit production feature set.
cargo build -p bloom --no-default-features --features mount

# Developer triad bootstrap. This feature is forbidden in release bundles.
cargo build -p bloom --no-default-features \
  --features mount,triad-dev-harness

# Optional heavy revert-decoder fallback.
cargo build -p bloom --no-default-features \
  --features mount,bytecode-decompile
```

Build Broker and Signer from their own repositories. Release artifacts must be
built through `packaging/triad/release/`; a locally compiled set of binaries is
not a release candidate.

## The efficient triad workflow

Use the cheapest loop that still crosses the boundary you changed.

### Loop 1: owning-repository tests

Most work should stay here. Run the affected package or named test while
editing. Before publishing, run the
[validation gates appropriate to the change](./TESTING.md#validation-gates).

Do not start overlapping Cargo commands in one target directory. Separate
repositories can build concurrently. Separate worktrees of one repository need
distinct `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` values.

### Loop 2: stable services, developer-managed Machine

Use `--services-only` for repeated Machine, CLI, VFS, daemon, or Solana changes.
It keeps real Broker and Signer services running while you rebuild and restart
Machine yourself. No kernel mount or sudo rule is needed.

Terminal 1:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.bloom/triad-dev/machine-home" /tmp/bloom-triad-logs

scripts/triad-dev-launch.sh \
  --developer-root "$HOME/.bloom/triad-dev" \
  --machine-home "$HOME/.bloom/triad-dev/machine-home" \
  --machine-socket /tmp/bloom-triad-machine.sock \
  --log-dir /tmp/bloom-triad-logs \
  --ready-file /tmp/bloom-triad-ready \
  --services-only
```

Terminal 2:

```sh
source /tmp/bloom-triad-logs/triad.env
cargo build -p bloom --no-default-features \
  --features mount,triad-dev-harness
bloom serve --endpoint "$BLOOM_RPC_ENDPOINT"
```

Stop and restart only Machine between edits. Restart the launcher when the
Broker or Signer binary, their configuration, enrollment, or an authority
protocol changes.

### Loop 3: complete out-of-process triad

Use the full launcher for ceremonies, authenticated transport, process
lifecycle, end-to-end signing, and mounted-VFS behavior:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.bloom/triad-dev/machine-home" \
  /tmp/bloom-triad-mount /tmp/bloom-triad-logs

scripts/triad-dev-launch.sh \
  --developer-root "$HOME/.bloom/triad-dev" \
  --machine-home "$HOME/.bloom/triad-dev/machine-home" \
  --mount /tmp/bloom-triad-mount \
  --machine-socket /tmp/bloom-triad-machine.sock \
  --log-dir /tmp/bloom-triad-logs \
  --ready-file /tmp/bloom-triad-ready
```

Omit `--mount` unless the test specifically concerns the kernel adapter. Linux
mounts require a narrowly scoped noninteractive sudo rule for that exact
mountpoint. VFS commands and services-only mode do not.

The launcher uses real protocol implementations and authenticated triad
transport. The developer profile runs them under the same non-root login and
therefore makes no production principal-isolation claim. On Linux it installs
temporary per-user systemd socket units for Broker and Signer; an active
systemd user manager is required. Paths embedded in those units may contain
only ASCII letters, digits, and `_./:@+-`.

Linux also uses the reviewed `linux-chrony-nts` trusted-time profile. The host
clock must already be synchronized through the production two-source NTS
configuration; the developer harness does not replace it with unauthenticated
NTP.

The launcher writes public connection settings to
`/tmp/bloom-triad-logs/triad.env`. Source that file only in the terminal meant
to address this candidate. It places the selected debug Machine binary first
on `PATH`.

### Test the binaries you intended

The launcher requires `../bloom-broker` and `../bloom-signer` to resolve even
when binary overrides are supplied. Arrange candidate checkouts side by side,
or provide those sibling names as symlinks in an isolated candidate directory;
do not replace another session's checkout or links. Binary overrides select the
executables, not the repository discovery paths. Build the candidate worktrees
first and pin all three binary paths explicitly:

```sh
cargo build -p bloom --no-default-features \
  --features mount,triad-dev-harness
cargo build --manifest-path ../BROKER_WORKTREE/Cargo.toml \
  -p bloom-broker --features triad-dev-harness
cargo build --manifest-path ../SIGNER_WORKTREE/Cargo.toml \
  -p bloom-signer --features triad-dev-harness

BLOOM_INTEGRATION_MACHINE_BIN="$PWD/target/debug/bloom" \
BLOOM_INTEGRATION_BROKER_BIN="$PWD/../BROKER_WORKTREE/target/debug/bloom-broker" \
BLOOM_INTEGRATION_SIGNER_BIN="$PWD/../SIGNER_WORKTREE/target/debug/bloom-signer" \
scripts/triad-dev-launch.sh \
  --developer-root "$HOME/.bloom/triad-dev" \
  --machine-home "$HOME/.bloom/triad-dev/machine-home" \
  --machine-socket /tmp/bloom-triad-machine.sock \
  --log-dir /tmp/bloom-triad-logs \
  --ready-file /tmp/bloom-triad-ready
```

Record the actual checkout revisions and dirty state as described under
[Cross-repository changes](#cross-repository-changes).

### Sharing a host with other candidates

The examples use fixed paths. Before running another candidate, give it a
distinct developer root, Machine home, socket, log directory, ready file, and
mountpoint. Suffixing each path with a candidate name is sufficient for state
isolation; the ceremony-port constraint below still applies.

Run one Machine per home. `bloom serve` and `bloom init` hold an exclusive lock
on the whole home for their lifetime, so a second one against the same home
fails with `Bloom home is already open for writing`. Every other command,
including all of `bloom vfs`, is a thin IPC client that never takes that lock:
the Machine serializes writes itself, so concurrent clients need no external
lease. A client with no Machine on its endpoint fails with `ipc <op> via
unix:<path>` rather than a lock error.

A client resolves its Machine in this order:

1. `--connect unix:<path>`
2. `--ipc-socket <path>` (compatibility alias)
3. `BLOOM_RPC_ENDPOINT`
4. `BLOOM_IPC_SOCKET` (compatibility alias)
5. `<BLOOM_HOME, else ~/.bloom>/run/bloom.sock`

Sourcing a candidate's `triad.env` sets `BLOOM_HOME` and `BLOOM_RPC_ENDPOINT`
together, which is why it belongs only in the terminal addressing that
candidate. An unsourced shell addresses `~/.bloom`, which is usually nobody's
triad.

Separate state paths do not isolate the ceremony listener at `127.0.0.1:18734`.
On Linux the launcher starts that systemd socket before checking
`--services-only`, so that mode also reserves the port. Run only one launcher
candidate at a time in the same network namespace; use separate disposable VMs
for concurrent full triads. The unique paths above prevent state collisions
when switching candidates, but do not remove this listener constraint.

## Cross-repository changes

Advance a candidate left to right:

1. Implement, test, and land the change in its owning repository, starting with
   service-runtime or contract dependencies when needed.
2. Advance downstream pins to the full 40-character landed commit, update the
   lockfile and other recorded compatibility refs, and test the affected seam.
3. Repeat in dependency order: Signer, Broker, Machine, then dependent Petals.
4. Run the out-of-process triad at the recorded three commits when behavior
   crosses services. Follow the [release package checks](./packaging/triad/release/README.md)
   for changes affecting the released combination.

Commit each manifest and regenerated lockfile together. Do not repeatedly repin
downstream repositories while upstream code is moving. A new source commit
invalidates evidence for that repository and every repository to its right,
but it does not invalidate already-passing upstream evidence.

Before integration, check the three worktrees and revisions in one pass:

```sh
git -C ../bloom-signer status --short
git -C ../bloom-broker status --short
git status --short
git -C ../bloom-signer rev-parse HEAD
git -C ../bloom-broker rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Keep at most one unmerged parent, including dependencies represented by Cargo
pins. If a temporary stacked candidate is needed, record the exact upstream
revisions and land the lowest PR first. Squash each PR into one landed commit;
then retarget its child and advance the child's pins to that landed commit.
Merge the base forward on branches pinned by downstream code; do not rebase
them. Avoid long-lived combined integration branches and keep temporary stack
details in the task's handoff rather than this contributor guide.

## BIP39 and derived-account development

Mnemonic import is a Broker-hosted owner ceremony. The CLI starts the ceremony;
the recovery phrase is entered only in the browser:

```sh
bloom wallet import imported-wallet
```

The current import profile is passphrase-free and creates the canonical EVM
and Solana account-number-zero children. See [Wallet architecture](./docs/architecture/Wallet.md#bip-39-roots-and-derived-accounts)
for supported inputs, derivation paths, and account-selection invariants.

Import projects the canonical EVM child and the native Solana child
together; read either one after the ceremony completes:

```sh
bloom wallet accounts imported-wallet
bloom wallet address imported-wallet --profile solana
bloom wallet address imported-wallet --profile evm
bloom vfs cat /wallets/imported-wallet/accounts.json
```

After more than one Solana child exists, select addresses by fingerprint and
retire accounts through the Broker-hosted authority ceremony:

```sh
bloom wallet address imported-wallet --profile solana \
  --fingerprint <full-or-unique-prefix>
bloom wallet account-retire imported-wallet \
  --fingerprint <full-fingerprint>
```

Complete the ceremony URL printed by retirement before expecting the
authenticated account projection to change.

Raw secp256k1 migration is a separate explicit ceremony:

```sh
bloom wallet import migrated-wallet --raw-private-key
```

It creates an imported scalar wallet, not a BIP39 root, and cannot derive a
Solana account.

## Solana development

Use [Solana native integration](./docs/architecture/Solana%20Native%20Integration.md)
for crate ownership, genesis and broadcast requirements, and account-addressed
VFS routes. Run the [Solana tests](./TESTING.md#triad-and-solana-ladders) that
exercise the behavior you changed.

## General local operation

An already running Machine may continue without Broker for cached public reads,
unsigned staging, and simulation where the public inputs exist. `status` and
`vfs cat` are IPC clients; setting `BLOOM_HOME` does not start a Machine. In a
terminal connected to the candidate (for example, after sourcing its
`triad.env`), inspect it with:

```sh
bloom status
bloom vfs cat /status/daemon.json
```

Signing, custody, approval mutation, and policy mutation must fail promptly
when Broker or Signer is unavailable. They must never restore a local authority
path.

The bounded mounted integration runner is:

```sh
scripts/local-mainnet-integration.sh --wallet test-wallet
```

Its preflight proves generic Petal-scoped derivation and payload signing. It
does not submit a venue order. Installed Petals remain external immutable
packages; do not patch Machine to preserve a retired Petal authority ABI.

## Launcher configuration

Source the candidate's `triad.env` to select its home, IPC endpoint, and
transport configuration together. Avoid assembling those settings by hand.
The launcher's optional controls are:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `BLOOM_TRIAD_DEV_MACHINE_CONFIG` | Config copied into a new developer Machine home |
| `BLOOM_TRIAD_DEV_AUTHORITY_FIXTURE` | Set to `1` to install the deterministic authority fixture |
| `BLOOM_TRIAD_DEV_BUILD_PETALS` | Set to `0` only for already-built reviewed Petals |
| `BLOOM_TRIAD_DEV_SOCKET_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Positive launcher socket timeout |

Binary overrides are covered [above](#test-the-binaries-you-intended);
test-specific variables are in [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md#environment-variables).

## Verification

Use the [change-to-test map](./TESTING.md#change-to-test-map) and
[validation gates](./TESTING.md#validation-gates). Packaging and installed
acceptance require a frozen candidate with recorded service revisions.

## Debugging the triad

The launcher writes `machine.log`, `broker.log`, `signer.log`, and `session.log`
under its log directory. Correlate a failure by operation ID and authenticated
receipt across processes. Do not copy ceremony capabilities or private input
into an issue or shared log.

Common failures:

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| A fix appears to have no effect | Confirm the three `BLOOM_INTEGRATION_*_BIN` paths and recorded commits |
| Cargo appears hung | Look for another Cargo process sharing the target directory |
| `Bloom home is already open for writing` | Another Machine owns that home; run one Machine and point clients at its socket |
| `ipc ... via unix:<path>` | No Machine on that endpoint; check `BLOOM_IPC_SOCKET`, `BLOOM_HOME`, and that `triad.env` was sourced |
| Linux services never become ready | Confirm an active systemd user manager and inspect Broker/Signer logs |
| Ceremony cannot bind | Check port `18734` and stop the older developer launcher |
| Enrollment is rejected as stale | Start with a new developer root; do not mutate custody files by hand |
| Wallet/account data is missing | Inspect the authenticated Broker projection and its freshness, not a legacy Machine wallet store |
| Solana broadcast is disabled | Check `allow_broadcast`, the pinned genesis, every endpoint, and chain status |
| Solana child selection is ambiguous | Use the full fingerprint/account path; never select by list position |

Useful public diagnostics include:

```sh
bloom vfs cat /status/daemon.json
bloom vfs cat /status/chains/<chain>/connected
bloom vfs cat /status/outbox/pending_count
bloom vfs cat /status/backends/summary.json
bloom vfs cat /wallets/<wallet>/accounts.json
```
