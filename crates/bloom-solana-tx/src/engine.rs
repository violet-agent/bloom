//! The Solana transfer engine: stage → confirm/sign → verified simulation → broadcast,
//! mirroring `bloom-tx`'s `TxEngine` shape for the native-transfer MVP.
//!
//! The engine owns the orchestration: it fetches the recent blockhash, builds
//! the canonical legacy message, stages it in the durable outbox, signs it
//! through the Broker/Signer triad (the [`crate::signing::SolanaTransferSigner`]),
//! records the signature, assembles the signed transaction, and broadcasts it
//! via the read client's gated `sendTransaction`. Reconciliation is separate
//! (see [`crate::reconcile`]).
