# Bloom virtual filesystem

This is the route reference for the mounted operator interface. Read the
mount's `AGENTS.md` for action-selection and recovery rules, and
[examples.md](./examples.md) for complete procedures. Contributor setup lives
in the repository's `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

Work from a scratch directory outside the mount and set its actual location:

```sh
BLOOM="<bloom-vfs-mount>"
ls "$BLOOM"
cat "$BLOOM/AGENTS.md"
cat "$BLOOM/next.md"
```

Keep scratch files outside the mount. Discover configured wallets, chains, and
Petals before choosing paths; their names and availability vary by installation.

## Top-level routes

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | Identical operator instructions |
| `next.md` | Actions and projections needing attention |
| `chains/` | Configured EVM chain reads |
| `wallets/` | Public wallet/account projections, policy, transaction outboxes |
| `petals/` | Installed packages and their instructions |
| `requests/` | Planned, authority-gated paid HTTP requests |
| `outbox/` | Central action projections and correlation records |
| `simulate/` | EVM dry-run sessions; never broadcasts |
| `status/` | Daemon, chain, backend, and update status |
| `watch/` | Registered read watches and history |
| `ens/`, `prices/` | ENS resolution and price-provider reads |
| `addressbook/` | Named public addresses |
| `tools/` | Pure encoding, hashing, address, ABI, and unit helpers |
| `docs/` | Route reference, examples, installed-Petal index |
| `petal-key-requests/`, `petal-signing-requests/` | Broker-backed Petal request projections |

`chains/` is EVM-only. Solana status lives under
`status/chains/<solana-chain>/`; account reads live under
`wallets/<wallet>/chains/<solana-chain>/`. Native `defi/intents` and
Hyperliquid routes are retired; discover installed Petals instead.

## Reads

Public projections and metadata do not authorize a transaction. Chain, balance,
ENS, price, and status leaves can contact configured providers, consume quota,
and disclose the queried public identifier. Petal reads follow the package's
capabilities and network policy. Listing wallet accounts and reading their
addresses do not call chain RPC; read balance leaves explicitly.

Representative paths, relative to the mount:

| Data | Path |
|---|---|
| EVM chain identity/head | `chains/<chain>/chain_id`, `chains/<chain>/head/number` |
| EVM block/receipt | `chains/<chain>/blocks/<number>/full.json`, `chains/<chain>/tx/<hash>/receipt.json` |
| EVM address balance | `chains/<chain>/addresses/<address>/balance.json` |
| Token grammar and holdings | `chains/<chain>/addresses/<address>/tokens/{README.md,known.json}` |
| Token balance | `chains/<chain>/addresses/<address>/tokens/<contract>/balance.json` |
| NFT kind/owner | `chains/<chain>/contracts/<contract>/nft/{kind,owner_of/<token-id>}` |
| ENS / price | `ens/<name>/address`, `prices/spot/eth.usd` |
| Wallet identity | `wallets/<wallet>/{projection.json,accounts.json,address,addresses.json}` |
| Solana account | `wallets/<wallet>/chains/<chain>/accounts/<full-fingerprint>/{address,balance,balance.raw,balance.json}` |
| Solana status | `status/chains/<chain>/{status.json,slot,block_height}` |

Braces above abbreviate separate leaves, not action selectors. Solana
chain-level balance aliases resolve to account 0 and fail if its canonical
child is inactive. Use
the full fingerprint and derivation path from `accounts.json` for account
identity; never select by list position.

Numbered accounts live at `wallets/<wallet>/<n>/`: read `account.json` to
verify the keys, then use `chains/<chain>/outbox/` beneath that account to
stage and inspect its transactions. Wallet-level outboxes use account 0.
Account-aware Petals and delegated sessions live beneath the numbered account
at `petals/<petal>/` and `sessions/<petal>/<key-slot>/`; see the mount
`AGENTS.md` for account creation, session status, and revocation rules.

## Writes and authority

Every write is an operation: it may stage work, start a ceremony, consume
reusable authority, or broadcast. Inspect the exact action before confirmation,
and inspect the result before retrying. A timeout does not prove that a
transaction was not submitted.

| Operation | Route / procedure |
|---|---|
| Register wallet | `wallets/new`; [wallet creation](./examples.md#creating-a-wallet) |
| EVM transaction | `wallets/<wallet>/chains/<chain>/outbox/new.tx`; [Anvil workflow](./examples.md#local-anvil-transaction) |
| Solana transaction | Same outbox shape with strict JSON; [Solana workflow](./examples.md#solana-account-aware-reads-and-transfer) |
| Update policy | `wallets/<wallet>/policy.json`; [policy workflow](./examples.md#updating-wallet-policy) |
| Reusable authority | `wallets/<wallet>/sealed-approvals/` and `capabilities/` beneath the wallet |
| Petal operation | `petals/<name>/`; [installed package workflow](./examples.md#installed-petal-workflow) |
| Paid HTTP | `requests/`; inspect plan, wallet, payment protocol, cap, approval, and receipt |

Wallet registration is asynchronous and does not create a local wallet.
Read `wallets/registrations/<petname>/status.json`, verify `requested_name`,
complete the human ceremony, then check `COMPLETED` and `result.json`.
Mnemonic and raw-key input stays in the Broker-hosted browser ceremony.

For a transaction requiring fresh approval, inspect the same action's
`approval_challenge.json`, verify its identity and expiry, and retry its exact
`retry_path` only after the human approves. Read the resulting state and
receipt before reporting success; never restage merely because a pending path
disappeared.

Broker enforces Sealed Approval scope, expiry, limits, counters, and revocation.
Machine and Petals cannot mint or broaden that authority. For
`policy.json` updates, Broker runs `policy.validate_update` before the
ceremony and `policy.commit_update` on the authorized retry. Reuse the
**exact same proposed bytes**, then verify the committed policy and terminal
update status.
