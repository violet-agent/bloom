# Solana Native Integration

**Status:** implemented for local, devnet, and explicitly enabled mainnet use
on the unmerged BIP-39/Solana stack. Automated validation and genuine WebAuthn
verification with a virtual authenticator pass; a physical-authenticator
rehearsal remains a release gate.
**Audience:** Bloom engineers, Petal authors, and implementation agents

## The decision

Solana is a first-class part of `bloom` itself — integrated **the same way
EVM is integrated**: in-tree crates (`bloom-solana`, `bloom-solana-tx`), not a
sandboxed, content-addressed Petal package. This supersedes an earlier
approach (`feat/solana-support`, PR #166, the `bloom-petal-solana` repo) that
shipped Solana as a **verified-chain-Petal**: a driver Petal plus a parallel
mini-Machine (`bloom-solana-machine`), a second CLI (`bloom-solana-cli`), a
bespoke signed catalog, and an RPC mediator (`bloom-chain-rpc`).

That work is **parked as reference, not deleted, not developed further** —
it stays available for the reusable pieces it produced (see "What carried
forward" below), but it is not the pattern for adding Solana, or any future
chain, to Bloom.

## Why the Petal shape was rejected

The verified-chain-Petal design duplicated facilities the Bloom Petal
runtime already provides: `bloom:http`'s `net.allow` policy, daemon-mediated
`chain_read`, `bloom:sign@0.2.0`'s `sign_payload_outcome`, durable
`petal_signing_requests`, and `PreinstalledPetal` pinning. Standing up a
parallel mini-Machine and a bespoke signed catalog to reimplement those,
just for one chain, was scope the Petal boundary exists specifically to
avoid. The Petal sandbox is the right shape for domain plugins that need
isolation from Bloom Machine's own trust boundary — one more base-layer
blockchain is not that; it belongs in the same crate family as every other
chain Bloom talks to directly.

## What "native" means concretely

- **Crate shape, not custody mechanism.** `bloom-solana` (read-only chain
  client) and `bloom-solana-tx` (transfer engine, outbox, reconciliation)
  mirror `bloom-evm` and `bloom-tx`'s shape and directory conventions
  exactly: `<home>/.solana-outbox/<wallet>/<chain>/{pending,sent,failed}/<id>/...`,
  a public `intent.json` atomically updated on state transitions, and a
  `receipt.json` sibling once finalized. Pre-broadcast signatures and approval
  proofs remain private host sidecars. While owner action is required, a
  sanitized `approval_challenge.json` exposes only the reviewed transfer facts,
  approval id, expiry, ceremony URL, and exact retry path through the VFS; it is
  removed before broadcast and on every terminal transition. EVM's own
  crates are `alloy`-typed throughout with no chain-agnostic trait to
  implement against, so this is a parallel crate family, not a shared
  abstraction over EVM's — see `crates/bloom-solana-tx/src/outbox.rs` vs
  `crates/bloom-tx/src/outbox.rs` for how close the mirroring is today (real
  duplication, tracked as a deliberate, separately-scoped follow-up rather
  than a bad shared abstraction rushed to avoid it).
- **Custody: the same Signer+Broker triad EVM uses**, not a bespoke Solana
  keystore. Solana keys come from the BIP-39 multicurve derivation
  (`wallet.accounts`, `AccountAllocate`) — the same seed phrase / passkeys
  that produce the EVM address produce the Solana one. Signing goes through
  the same `TriadSigningService`/`MachineBrokerClient` pattern EVM's
  `transaction.confirm` exact-signing already uses; Solana didn't invent a
  parallel signing seam.
- **RPC transport is a parallel, not reused, stack.** `bloom-rpc`'s
  Ethereum-typed layers (`RootProvider<Ethereum>`, the `alloy` transport
  stack) don't fit Solana's JSON-RPC shape. What *is* shared, via
  `bloom-rpc-common` (chain-agnostic by design): `HealthRegistry` (endpoint
  cooldown/scoring) and the retry-classification rule table. Solana's own
  `reqwest`-based transport reimplements alloy's retry/throttle/fallback/probe
  pattern on top of those shared pieces rather than the `alloy` stack itself.
- **Mount surface unchanged.** Solana chains route through the existing
  `wallets/<wallet>/chains/<chain>/...` VFS family alongside EVM chains —
  same outbox route shape (`outbox/new.tx`, `outbox/pending/<id>/{confirm,cancel}`,
  `outbox/{pending,sent,failed}/<id>/...`), dispatched to a Solana transfer
  engine instead of the EVM `TxEngine` when the chain name resolves to one.
  See `crates/bloom-vfs/src/handlers/wallets.rs`'s `lookup_chain`/`list_chain`
  for the dispatch point, and `docs/examples-domain/01-chains.md` for the
  general (currently EVM-focused) walkthrough of that surface's read side.

## Registered semantic verifier: authoritative on the native signing path

Broker contains the Anza-based, golden-vector-pinned
`solana-system-transfer-v1` verifier carried forward from the parked Petal
work. The native engine sends a `SystemUseClaim` with `ProofVerified`
assurance and the serialized message as assurance evidence. Broker checks the
evidence digest, selects the digest-pinned compiled verifier, independently
re-parses the message, and requires it to establish the destination, debit,
payload digest, and recent blockhash before policy can authorize signing.
Genesis and last-valid height remain explicit claim context and are rechecked
against the live RPC by Machine; the verifier does not pretend those facts are
encoded in a Solana message. Machine-asserted claims, mismatched evidence, incomplete
verifier results, and destinations outside policy fail closed. Broker
integration tests exercise this complete `authority.authorize()` path.

Machine then rechecks the locally recorded Ed25519 signature, current
blockheight, and live cluster genesis; runs signature-verifying simulation over
the exact transaction bytes; and requires `sendTransaction` to return the
same signature before advancing durable state.

## Provenance and operator configuration

The provenance catalog gains a `solana.transfer.confirm` entry
authorizing the native-transfer operation class, documented in
[`2026-08-18-solana-provenance-catalog.md`](../specs/2026-08-18-solana-provenance-catalog.md).
Operator-facing chain configuration lives in `[solana_chains.<name>]`,
parallel to `[chains.<name>]` for EVM — `Config::validate()` refuses a
config where a chain name is configured in both.

## Mainnet posture

Newly generated configuration includes `solana-mainnet`, using the public
`https://api.mainnet.solana.com` RPC endpoint and the pinned mainnet genesis
hash. Its `allow_broadcast` defaults to `false`. Devnet and local validators
remain explicitly configured networks. Loading an existing configuration does
not add Solana networks or overwrite endpoint and broadcast settings.

The public endpoint is rate-limited; operators can replace it with their own
RPC endpoint under `[solana_chains.solana-mainnet]`. See Solana's
[public RPC documentation](https://solana.com/docs/references/clusters).

Mainnet uses the ordinary Solana transaction path. Operators must explicitly
enable `allow_broadcast` and pin `expected_genesis_base58`; Machine verifies every
configured endpoint against that genesis at staging and again before its
single broadcast attempt. Broker policy and the passkey ceremony remain
mandatory.

### Broadcast eligibility is not a delivery guarantee

`status/chains/<chain>/status.json` reports `broadcast.eligible`. That means
only two things held: the operator enabled broadcast, and live genesis
verification succeeded against **every** configured endpoint at the moment of
the read. It is not a prediction that a transaction will be accepted or will
land — fees, blockhash expiry, account state and validator admission all
still apply, and none of them are observable from a status read.

Genesis reporting distinguishes three states rather than two:

| `genesis.all_endpoints_verified` | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `true` | a genesis is pinned and every configured endpoint matched it |
| `false` | a genesis is pinned and verification failed or could not run |
| `null` | nothing is pinned, so nothing was verified — not an implicit pass |

## Reading Solana state through the VFS

Solana chains appear beside EVM chains under `wallets/<wallet>/chains/` and
in the global `status/chains/` tree. Two rules shape the surface.

**Accounts are addressed by full fingerprint.** The canonical per-account
path is `chains/<chain>/accounts/<full-lowercase-fingerprint>/`, exposing
`address`, `balance`, `balance.raw` and `balance.json`. `accounts/` exists
whenever the chain is configured — empty when no child is active — so the
namespace does not change shape as children are allocated or retired. A
unique fingerprint *prefix* is accepted as input convenience when staging a
transfer through `new.tx`, but never as a path: a prefix that is unique today
becomes ambiguous when the next child is allocated.

The chain-level `balance`, `balance.raw` and `balance.json` leaves are
single-child conveniences. On a wallet with several active Solana children
they fail and name the canonical `accounts/<fingerprint>/` paths rather than
selecting by projection order.

**Reads that need the chain are exactly the reads that say so.** Listing an
account directory, stat-ing any leaf, and reading `address` are served from
the Broker's `wallet.accounts` projection alone. Only `balance*` and the
chain status leaves contact a Solana node. A wallet therefore stays
inspectable while a cluster is unreachable, and listing a wallet never fans
out one RPC call per child.

Chain status is published once per chain under
`status/chains/<solana-chain>/`, not repeated beneath every wallet, because
RPC health, cluster identity and broadcast posture are properties of the
chain. Each observation in `status.json` is attempted independently: a failed
call degrades its own field to `null` and records a reason under `errors`
while the rest of the document still renders. Endpoint URLs are redacted
wherever they appear, including inside error text.

Solana chain directories deliberately do not carry `chain_id` or
`block_number`. Solana has neither, and publishing an EVM-shaped view of it
would be a lie of convenience; it exposes `slot` and `block_height` instead.

## What carried forward from the parked Petal work

Not everything from PR #166 was Petal-hosting machinery with nothing left
to host once the shape changed. Reused directly:

- The Anza-based semantic verifier (`solana-system-transfer-v1`) described
  above, now authoritative on the native signing path.
- BIP-39 SLIP-10 Ed25519 derivation — never Petal-shaped; it's the same
  derivation infrastructure EVM's HD wallets use.
- CAIP-2 chain-identity mapping and golden test vectors.

Not reused: the mini-Machine, the second CLI, the bespoke signed catalog,
the `bloom-chain-rpc` mediator, and `bloom-chain-action`'s outbox/artifact
template system — all superseded by mirroring EVM's existing outbox/
reconciliation pattern instead of inventing a Petal-hosting equivalent.
