# Agent-native Documentation

**Status:** architecture overview
**Audience:** Bloom engineers, Petal authors, and implementation agents

Bloom's VFS is self-documenting. An agent pointed at a Bloom mount must be
able to discover how to use it by reading files inside the mount, without
prior knowledge of Bloom. This document describes the surfaces that provide
that, how they are kept honest, and what must be added to them as the
platform evolves.

## Mount-Root Guidance: `/AGENTS.md` and `/CLAUDE.md`

The primary surface is a single guidance document served at the mount root
under two aliases, `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, so that both generic agents
and Claude-family tooling find it by convention.

How it works today:

- The content is a vendored markdown file,
  `crates/bloom-vfs/src/docs/agent-guidance.md`, embedded into the binary at
  compile time via `include_bytes!` in the VFS router
  (`crates/bloom-vfs/src/router.rs`).
- The root `Vfs` router itself — not a Petal handler — serves it: root
  listings include both filenames, lookups return a read-only file entry
  (mode `0o444`), and reads return the embedded bytes verbatim. Writes are
  not routable to these paths.
- The source filename is not exposed through `/docs`; the guidance is only
  readable through the root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` aliases.

Because the content is compiled into the Bloom Machine, the documentation an agent
reads is always the documentation of the exact binary serving the mount.
There is no runtime templating and no way for the served guidance to drift
from the release it ships with.

## What the Guidance Covers

`agent-guidance.md` ("Working with bloom") currently documents:

- mounting and the `bloom vfs ls`/`bloom vfs cat` facade;
- the authority security model: reads, staging, and simulation remain
  Machine-owned; signing uses Broker authorization and Signer-held keys; the
  owner key is never handed to an agent or Machine;
- the outbox stage/confirm flow;
- paid HTTP under `/requests` (staging, `plan.md`, `confirm`, spend caps);
- the mounted Sealed Approval lifecycle for the outbox confirm flow —
  permission-denied confirm writes, `approval_challenge.json`,
  `ceremony_url`, completed Broker approval, and retrying the bound action.
  Solana chains dispatch through the identical
  `wallets/<wallet>/chains/<chain>/outbox/...` mechanism (see
  [`Solana Native Integration.md`](./Solana%20Native%20Integration.md)), so
  this is no longer EVM-only;
- discovery of installed Petal docs and route contracts;
- passkey policy-update custody and advisory `under_policy` semantics.

As additional Petals adopt the mounted Sealed Approval flow described in
[`Interaction Modes.md`](./Interaction%20Modes.md), the guidance must stay the
discovery mechanism for that contract: the permission-denied signal on a confirm
write, reading `approval_challenge.json` from the same pending directory,
forwarding or opening `ceremony_url`, waiting for Broker to report activation,
and retrying the bound action. There is no per-action
hint file and no per-directory README duplication of global contracts.

## Per-surface documentation

Built-in handlers embed read-only, handler-local documentation, while external
Petals expose package-defined route documentation under `/petals/<name>/`.
For example, an installed Polymarket Petal exposes `/petals/polymarket/README.md`,
`/petals/polymarket/AGENTS.md`, and
`/petals/polymarket/meta/route-contract.json`. Per-request `plan.md` files under
`/requests` are per-instance previews rather than static docs.

An installed Petal's `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` come directly from its
validated, content-addressed package. The Bloom Petal router serves those two
files read-only at the Petal mount root instead of dispatching them through
Petal-supplied WASM. This keeps operator and agent guidance available before an
agent invokes any Petal route and prevents a dynamic route from shadowing the
packaged documentation.

The division of labor:

- the root guidance documents cross-cutting contracts: the security model,
  the action lifecycle, approvals, and where things live;
- a Petal README documents only Petal-local paths and semantics, and links
  back to the shared contracts rather than restating them.

Venue integrations that graduate to external Petals must not retain a native
CLI, root-level VFS subtree, daemon mount, or daemon-owned venue state. The
installed package documentation becomes authoritative, while Bloom retains
only generic host capabilities and any wallet-policy schema the Petal consumes.

## Keeping It Honest

Two mechanisms keep the served documentation truthful:

**Tests pin the surface.** The router tests assert that the root lists both
`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` as read-only files, that the served bytes are
byte-identical to the vendored source file, and that the content passes
sanity checks. Petal router tests assert that package `README.md` and
`AGENTS.md` files are listed, readable, and immutable. Built-in handlers carry
similar tests for their retained handler-local documentation. External venue
guidance is tested as content-addressed Petal package documentation.

**The PR checklist enforces updates.** The repository's pull request
template includes a mandatory "Agent Documentation updated" item, enforced
by a required status check (see `.github/pull_request_template.md` and
`.github/workflows/pr-checklist.yml`). Any change that alters agent-visible
behavior — new paths, changed lifecycles, new approval semantics — must
update `agent-guidance.md` and/or the affected Petal READMEs in the same PR,
or explicitly justify why no update is needed.

## Extension Points

- The router exposes a `root_dynamic` registration mechanism for dynamic
  root-level files. The Bloom Machine uses it for `/next.md`, a Bloom Machine-rendered "what
  needs my attention" aggregator for agent workflows.
- New global agent-facing documents belong at the mount root or under
  `/docs`, embedded at compile time and covered by byte-identity tests, not
  generated at runtime and not scattered per-directory.

## Requirements Summary

- Every Bloom mount must serve `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the root,
  read-only, byte-identical to the vendored source, versioned with the
  binary.
- Global contracts (security model, action lifecycle, Sealed Approval
  discovery) live in the root guidance; Petal READMEs stay Petal-local.
- Documentation changes ship in the same PR as the behavior they describe,
  enforced by the PR checklist.
