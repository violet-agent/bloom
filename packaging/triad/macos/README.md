# Bloom triad macOS Unix-principal packaging source

This directory implements the root-requiring Unix-principal profile in
`docs/specs/2026-07-29-macos-unix-principal-isolation.md`. It is source input
for the signed installer and is never installed directly from a checkout.
The PF network boundary in that original profile is retired: current macOS
packages preserve Private Relay and do not enforce service network isolation.
See [the migration and sandbox plan](../../../docs/operations/macos-private-relay.md).

The rootless code-identity architecture remains documented as a future target
in `docs/specs/2026-07-30-macos-rootless-code-identity-isolation.md`. Nothing
in this directory may emit its `macos-rootless-code-identity` platform claim or
substitute App Groups, same-UID LaunchAgents, or Keychain groups for the Unix
principal boundaries.

## Service topology

For each enrolled login UID, the installer renders two system-domain
LaunchDaemons:

- `com.bloom.broker.LOGIN_UID`, running as `bloom-broker-LOGIN_UID`;
- `com.bloom.signer.LOGIN_UID`, running as `bloom-signer-LOGIN_UID`.

Each daemon explicitly binds its Unix sockets inside endpoint directories
owned by that service UID. The directories use distinct edge groups and mode
`0710`; a service validates this metadata before publishing a `0660` socket.
Broker and Signer have separate revocation subdirectories. This construction
is required because a launchd-created Unix socket reports launchd's UID to the
connecting peer on macOS, which cannot satisfy the protocol's mutual kernel
peer-UID check. It does not fall back from failed launchd activation or create
endpoints outside the signed profile.

Broker owns the canonical ceremony listeners by direct exclusive bind to
`127.0.0.1:18734` and `[::1]:18734`. Both families are required because
Chromium resolves `localhost` to `::1` before `127.0.0.1`. The LaunchDaemon
does not declare or pre-bind either TCP socket. A conflict is fatal, reported,
retried by failure-only `KeepAlive`, and never selects a fallback address or
port. Before exiting, Broker atomically writes a Broker-owned,
Machine-readable `broker-startup.json`. Machine accepts only its exact owner,
group, mode, schema, address, incident, and message, so a listener acquisition
failure is reported promptly. The service log identifies the failing address
or inherited descriptor and its error. An unavailable IPv6 stack is not
evidence that another process owns the port. A successful retry removes the
stale diagnostic.

The global `com.bloom.session` LaunchAgent invokes only Machine's
`serve session-sentinel` mode. It exits successfully for an unenrolled login,
keeps no custody or signing authority, and is destroyed with its GUI login
domain. It owns `session/session.sock` as the login UID and authenticates a
separately pinned `bloom-session` identity. The socket reuses the already
declared revoke group, whose membership contains the login, Broker, and
Signer, while mutual application-key authentication distinguishes the two
service channels. Broker authenticates before binding the canonical ceremony
listener; Signer authenticates before accepting RPC. Both drain and exit
successfully on disconnect. The root containment monitor validates a returning
session socket's enrolled UID, group, mode, and type and kickstarts only that
enrollment's stopped Signer and Broker jobs. It does nothing while the
sentinel is absent; the LaunchAgent itself has no system-job control authority.

The global `com.bloom.machine` LaunchAgent runs `bloom serve --mount-home` for
each enrolled login. Machine resolves the effective login's installed
enrollment, serves its normal `~/.bloom/run/bloom.sock` endpoint, and mounts the
VFS at `~/bloom`. The generic template contains no username or home-directory
literal and exits fail-closed when the effective login is not enrolled.

## Filesystem and network boundaries

The installer renders the root-owned release, edge manifest, account/group
record, LaunchDaemon definitions, and session LaunchAgent. It installs no PF
anchor; legacy anchors are removed by post-activation migration. Broker and
Signer state/checkpoint roots remain owned by their
respective service UIDs and mode `0700`.

The installer keeps digest-named releases immutable. A same-digest install
verifies every installed binary and repairs integration files without replacing
custody. A compatible different digest is staged, all enrolled jobs are stopped,
the shared `current` symlink and enrollment build digests are switched
atomically, and launchd is required to stop and restart the installed jobs. A
durable intent makes the next invocation finish the transaction after
interruption; an upgrade that fails authenticated health restores the prior
release when it can still pass the same check. Compatibility metadata is mandatory and
a state-schema downgrade is rejected before services are stopped.

Canonical executables live under
`/usr/local/libexec/bloom/releases/RELEASE_DIGEST`; the root-owned `current`
selector moves atomically between those immutable directories. The supported
interactive command is the relative symlink
`/usr/local/bin/bloom -> ../libexec/bloom/current/bloom`, so it follows every
repair and upgrade without putting `libexec` itself on `PATH`. Installer
preflight accepts only that exact managed symlink and refuses to overwrite a
regular file, directory, or differently targeted link. The command remains
available while any login has an active enrollment and is removed when the last
active enrollment is retained or purged; restore recreates it.

Once authenticated activation has committed, the installer migrates the
enrolled login away from the supported historical standalone location
`~/.local/bin/bloom`. The home is resolved from Directory Service, and only a
regular file or final-component symlink at that exact path is unlinked with the
login user's authority. Parent symlinks and unexpected filesystem objects are
rejected, and no user-owned binary is executed for identification. Cleanup is
deliberately post-activation: a failed activation preserves the old command,
while a cleanup failure reports the installation as incomplete without rolling
back healthy custody. Other `bloom` commands on `PATH` are not scanned or
deleted. After migration, a shell that cached the old command may need `hash -r`
(POSIX shells), `rehash` (zsh/csh), or a new terminal.

Legacy wallet data is not deleted with the standalone command. When
`~/.bloom/keystore` exists, successful activation prints its resolved absolute
location and exact staging and ceremony commands for every detected v1 passkey
wallet. The staging command uses the packaged `bloom-signer-migrate`, the
installed Signer configuration, and the enrollment's actual login and Signer
UID/GID. It requires `sudo` to enter Signer's private state and assign isolated
ownership. The subsequent `/usr/local/bin/bloom wallet migrate-passkey`
command must run without `sudo` as the enrolled login. Other legacy wallet
kinds are unsupported by this bounded converter and remain untouched at the
reported legacy location.

`uninstall --retain-custody / LOGIN_UID` removes launchd, packet-filter, and
runtime integration while preserving service principals, identities, and
encrypted state. `restore` accepts only the exact signed retained release and
reinstalls its integration without rotating custody. Permanent deletion remains
a separate `delete-bloom-login-LOGIN_UID` confirmation and is described as a
purge because it destroys custody irrecoverably. Upgrade and restore never run
enrollment-material generation and never rotate transport or custody identity.

Production enrollment invokes the installed Machine binary's root-only
enrollment-material mode against the signed public templates in `config/`.
Five application identities and the Broker/Signer signing authorities are
fresh per login; only their public cross-pins enter the root-owned manifest.
The temporary root-only generation directory is removed on success or error.
The root-owned enrollment record uses `activating` while durable files are being
converged and is published `active` once the requested digest is selected.
Authenticated runtime health on the selected digest is an installer commit
condition. A failed fresh install removes Directory Service records
created by that invocation. An interrupted upgrade retains its forward intent
so the next invocation can finish the same convergence safely.

Broker and Signer have `network_containment: null`. No PF rules are installed
or enabled. Successful install, repair, upgrade and restore remove legacy Bloom
anchors from disk and flush only their live filter rules. Uninstall scopes that
cleanup to the removed login. The main system ruleset is never reloaded. Old
PF enable tokens cannot be safely attributed to Bloom and are left alone.

The root lifecycle monitor retains the `com.bloom.containment` job and
`triad-pf-monitor` CLI names for upgrade compatibility. It still validates the
returning session and restarts stopped services, but does not read or write PF.
Legacy schema-v3 telemetry explicitly reports `available: false` and
`network_enforcement: "none"`; it cannot satisfy an older PF consumer.

This is an intentional reduction in defense against a compromised Broker or
Signer making network connections. Unix UID isolation, filesystem and socket
permissions, authenticated RPC, signing policy, and session revocation remain.
The disposable macOS W0 lane now checks PF retirement instead of asserting
network denial and does not emit the original MUI-07 containment evidence.

Static template and staged-root tests are conformance inputs, not proof of an
operating-system boundary. Tests that create accounts, load LaunchDaemons,
change `pf`, or exercise multiple GUI users run only on disposable macOS VMs.
The guarded harness and its current coverage are documented under `w0/`.

## Service logs

Broker and Signer write complete JSON Lines records to
`/private/var/log/bloom/LOGIN_UID/{broker,signer}.jsonl`. The enrolled user can
read these files without `sudo` but cannot modify them; service state remains
private. Rotation is bounded by `/etc/newsyslog.d/bloom-LOGIN_UID.conf` and
does not require restarting either daemon. Session and containment lifecycle
messages use launchd's native process logging rather than the per-enrollment
diagnostic files.

Each daemon also has a small bounded `SERVICE-bootstrap.log` launchd stderr
fallback. It is only for fixed, sanitized initialization failures that happen
before the canonical app writer is available; routine events never use it.
