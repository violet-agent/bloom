# Bloom triad Linux packaging source

This directory is source input for the privileged installer. It is not
installed directly from a source checkout.

The installer creates one system-owned instance for each interactive login UID
that has Bloom enabled. For login UID `1000`, the effective principals are
`bloom-broker-1000` and `bloom-signer-1000`; the Machine continues to run as
the interactive login principal. The generated `sysusers.d` and `tmpfiles.d`
files form two deliberately non-transitive data-plane groups:

- the login principal and Broker share `bloom-machine-broker-1000`;
- Broker and Signer share `bloom-broker-signer-1000`;
- the login principal is not a member of the Broker--Signer group.

The separate `bloom-revoke-1000` group reaches only the two control sockets.
It grants no access to either data-plane socket.

Broker and Signer own their four authenticated Unix sockets so Linux
`SO_PEERCRED` reports the actual security-service UID in both directions.
Systemd owns only the canonical ceremony listeners, where Unix peer credentials
are unavailable, and passes them to Broker. Both loopback families are published
on port 18734 — `127.0.0.1` as `broker-ceremony-ipv4` and `[::1]` as
`broker-ceremony-ipv6` — because Chromium resolves `localhost` to `::1` before
`127.0.0.1`, so an IPv4-only listener leaves the canonical origin unreachable
about half the time. Broker takes each by name and never binds one itself; each family is
published by its own socket unit, and the host must have IPv6 loopback
enabled (`::1` bindable) because the Broker exits when either listener is
missing — `net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6=1` is unsupported. The installer
checks this before installing anything: it requires `disable_ipv6=0` for `lo`
and `::1` assigned to `lo`, and otherwise exits with status 69. The
authenticated login-session sentinel owns its Unix socket while the user's
systemd session is active. A path unit starts Broker and Signer only after that
session socket exists. A canonical-listener conflict therefore fails that family's socket unit
(`bloom-broker-ceremony@UID.socket` or `bloom-broker-ceremony-ipv6@UID.socket`)
and never selects another port.

The user-owned `bloom-machine.service` starts the long-running Machine and
mounts its VFS at `~/bloom` for the lifetime of the login session. NFS mounts
normally require privilege, so the installer adds one exact `/etc/fstab`
authorization from `127.0.0.1:/` to that login's `~/bloom` with
`noauto,user,nosuid,nodev,noexec` and the complete fixed-port NFS option set.
The installer allocates a distinct loopback port for every enrolled login,
records it in the root-owned enrollment and Machine environment, and renders the
same port into that login's fstab authorization. The packaged Machine asks the
existing system mount helper to resolve `~/bloom` from fstab; it cannot supply a
different source, target, port, or mount option. Before mounting, Machine
detects and force-detaches only the expected stale loopback NFS mount; a foreign
filesystem at `~/bloom` is rejected. Machine still runs as the login principal
and receives neither a sudoers rule nor `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. The service deliberately
does not block the distribution's setuid mount helper, because that helper is
what enforces the exact fstab delegation. The unit therefore cannot use systemd
settings that implicitly enable `NoNewPrivileges` (`RestrictNamespaces`,
`RestrictRealtime`, `LockPersonality`, `MemoryDenyWriteExecute`,
`RestrictAddressFamilies`, or `RestrictSUIDSGID`): that would suppress the
distribution mount helper's reviewed setuid transition. It retains compatible
hardening (`UMask=0077`, `RemoveIPC=yes`, and `LimitCORE=0`).
Uninstall stops Machine before removing this per-login fstab entry.

State roots and service configuration live below principal-owned mode-0700
directories. The edge manifest and binaries are root-owned and not writable by
any product principal. The local Signer service permits only `AF_UNIX`.
The AWS KMS drop-in is a separate installer-rendered, instance-specific
profile. For UID `1000`, the installer renders it to
`bloom-signer@1000.service.d/50-aws-kms.conf`; it enables IP sockets but
retains `IPAddressDeny=any`. The installer must render the reviewed KMS
endpoint CIDRs as `IPAddressAllow` entries. Empty or wildcard egress is an
installer error.

The templates use `@...@` placeholders where packaging must supply an absolute
binary path, login identity, or reviewed egress list. `%i` is the systemd
instance specifier and is intentionally left for systemd.

The installer publishes `/usr/bin/bloom-uninstall`. Running it through `sudo`
without `--purge` removes runtime integration but retains the selected login's
configuration and custody state. `--purge` additionally requires the exact
`delete-bloom-login-LOGIN_UID` token before deleting that material. Shared
runtime files remain while any active enrollment needs them, and the
uninstaller remains while retained custody is present.

For the login account that invoked `sudo`, the commands are:

```sh
sudo bloom-uninstall
sudo bloom-uninstall --purge "delete-bloom-login-$(id -u)"
```

The root-owned edge manifest pins `trusted_time_source` to
`linux-system-clock`. Bloom reads the ordinary host wall clock and protects
rolling windows with its own durable nondecreasing floor. On the same boot it
also compares wall-clock progress with a suspend-aware monotonic anchor, so a
large unexpected forward step degrades rate-limited signing. A later boot may
legitimately advance by more than the same-boot bound while the machine was
powered off. Bloom does not require Chrony or another time daemon.

Packaging creates a mode-0700 `audit-checkpoints` directory below each
service's state root and passes its absolute path through
`BLOOM_BROKER_AUDIT_CHECKPOINT_DIR` or
`BLOOM_SIGNER_AUDIT_CHECKPOINT_DIR`. Only that service principal can read or append
its checkpoint records. In particular, the Machine login and Broker cannot
read the Signer checkpoint root. Runtime checkpoint writes reject symlinks,
non-owned directories, sequence rollback, and replacement.

## Service logs

Machine, Broker, Signer, and the session sentinel emit JSON Lines to journald
under stable identifiers. For example:

```sh
journalctl --user -u bloom-machine.service -o cat
sudo journalctl -t bloom-broker-$(id -u) -o cat
sudo journalctl -t bloom-signer-$(id -u) -o cat
```

Journal persistence, retention, and read access remain host policy.
