# Bloom triad release package

`compatibility-v1.toml` is the closed v1 service matrix. It declares each edge
independently: the Machine–Broker and Broker–Signer authority APIs require
exactly 1.4, while Signer control and login-session liveness accept 1.0–1.1.
Service packages may advance independently when every edge remains inside its
declared range; incompatible edges fail closed.
It also records the reviewed Broker, Signer, service-runtime, and
Petal-contract commits plus the current state schema and downgrade floor for
Machine, Broker, and Signer. This committed file is the source of truth for
the Broker and Signer revisions: candidate builds require the supplied
checkouts to match its exact pins and never rewrite them.

`build-bundle.sh` accepts the three service binaries, the bounded
`bloom-signer-migrate` staging tool, and an ephemeral candidate key. It verifies semantic versions, scans every
staged and generated bundle file for release-blocking markers, records all
three Git revisions, embeds both platform installers, signs the internal
payload manifest for post-elevation verification, normalizes metadata, and
emits a deterministic archive with checksum, signature, and public key.
Release and conformance keys use OpenSSH Ed25519 format. Signatures use the
standard SSHSIG envelope with distinct `bloom-release-archive-v1`,
`bloom-release-payload-v1`, and `bloom-macos-conformance-v1` namespaces.
Verification invokes the OS-owned `/usr/bin/ssh-keygen`; the privileged macOS
path never executes a Homebrew- or login-user-owned crypto implementation.

`verify-bundle.sh` verifies the detached signature and both the outer and
internal checksums before accepting the compatibility matrix or installers.
Production verification accepts Linux ELF and macOS Mach-O bundles. The
non-production `macos-unix-principals-w0` claim accepts Mach-O binaries only
in its explicitly enabled disposable Darwin lane. The `test-unclaimed` marker requires the explicit
`BLOOM_ALLOW_TEST_UNCLAIMED=true` override at build, verification, and install;
neither test claim can be advertised as production.

Production `macos-unix-principals` bundles are authenticated by the same
reviewed release key as Linux bundles. Tart conformance remains available as
an optional manual validation suite, but its report is not an input to
production signing or publication. `macos-conformance-subject.sh`,
`sign-macos-conformance-report.sh`, and `verify-macos-conformance.sh` can bind
manual results to an exact candidate without changing the release contract.

For one candidate payload `C`, the disposable evidence matrix is:

- run the single-login W0 with `C` as its primary payload to produce MUI-01,
  MUI-02, MUI-03, MUI-04, MUI-07, MUI-08, MUI-10, MUI-11, MUI-12,
  `installed_ac_01_35`, and `negative_access`;
- on a two-GUI-login disposable VM, run the two-login W0 with a valid
  digest-distinct payload as the baseline, `C` as `UPGRADE_PAYLOAD`, and a
  distinct deliberately activation-failing payload as
  `FAILING_UPGRADE_PAYLOAD` to produce MUI-05, MUI-06, MUI-09, and
  `two_login_lifecycle`;
- merge only `.pass` files whose contents equal `C`'s canonical subject
  digest, then review and sign them with
  `sign-macos-conformance-report.sh`.

The signer refuses a mixture of evidence from different candidates.

`../release.sh` is the public local and CI entry point:

```sh
packaging/triad/release.sh build linux --output-dir DIR
packaging/triad/release.sh build macos --output-dir DIR
```

It defaults to the current `../bloom-broker` and `../bloom-signer` checkouts,
rejects dirty source inputs or HEADs that differ from the compatibility pins,
builds with locked dependencies, validates the selected binary architecture
and installer, assembles and verifies the bundle twice, and publishes
byte-identical `test-unclaimed` output. It does not run
repository-wide formatting, Clippy, or test suites; those are independent CI
source-quality gates. Both platforms emit the archive plus `.sha256`, `.sig`,
and `.pub` sidecars.

The release workflow builds the macOS aarch64 candidate on `macos-15` alongside
the Linux candidate. A manual `dry_run=true` dispatch uploads both
`test-unclaimed` candidates as Actions artifacts and cannot reach production
signing or GitHub publication. Live candidate installation requires both a
root-owned, non-writable pin of that artifact's ephemeral public key and the
explicit `BLOOM_ALLOW_TEST_UNCLAIMED=true` installer opt-in.

`release.sh sign linux|macos` is the isolated production signing pass. It never
executes a candidate-owned binary or script. It verifies the expected version,
source revisions, and target architecture, replaces the ephemeral inner
signature, deterministically repacks the payload, signs the outer checksum,
and refuses a private key that does not match the reviewed public key. GitHub
Actions makes the release key available only to the protected
`production-release` signing job. The tag workflow signs and publishes Linux
x86_64 and macOS aarch64 together as a normal GitHub Release.

Before merging release-workflow changes, dispatch the branch with
`dry_run=true`. That path builds the exact branch with an ephemeral test key,
uploads the `test-unclaimed` candidate for inspection, and skips both the
protected production-signing job and the publish job. Normal tag pushes and tag
retries cannot select dry-run mode.

Before compiling, `release.sh` rejects the remaining forbidden production
Machine features from the resolved normal/build Cargo graph. Bundle assembly
independently rejects forbidden paths, printable markers, and retained Machine
symbols.
Debug and accepting-test artifacts remain forbidden across the entire bundle.
Legacy authority markers, files, and symbols are scoped to the Machine
executable and explicit Machine-owned payload roots; conforming custody and
private-signer implementations in `bloom-signer` are not false positives.
The installed macOS acceptance additionally runs the packaged `bloom serve`
Machine against a same-principal hostile Broker socket and an accessible
hostile Signer sentinel, proving prompt fail-closed/degraded behavior, no
direct Signer connection, and no legacy Machine authority state.

Fault-injection acceptance tests remain separately linked test executables:
putting fault hooks into the production services would violate AC-20. Their
post-extraction rerun is bound to the exact clean source revisions recorded in
the signed bundle; process/artifact acceptance additionally executes and
inspects the extracted production binaries.

Linux instance configuration fixtures are site-specific security inputs and
are deliberately not reusable release credentials. Test-only staged
installer fixtures use the following `config/` layout beside the extracted binaries:
`edge-manifest.json`, `broker.json`, `signer.json`,
`machine-identity.json`, `broker-identity.json`, `signer-identity.json`,
`revoke-identity.json`, `session-identity.json`, `installer-identity.json`,
and `provenance-catalog.json`. The macOS W0 bundle deliberately contains none
of these private files: its guarded live installer uses the same fresh
root-owned identity-generation path as the production Unix-principal claim.
On Linux, Bloom uses the host system clock behind its durable rollback and
same-boot forward-step guards; it does not install or require a separate time
daemon. AWS credentials and `aws-kms-ip-allow.conf` are an optional paired
site overlay.

The Linux archive generates a complete fresh per-login enrollment from
packaged public templates and the host CSPRNG; it does not require site-specific
private identity inputs. It enables a login-user Machine service that maintains
the `~/bloom` mount without interactive sudo by installing one exact
`user,nosuid,nodev,noexec` loopback-NFS fstab authorization, including the fixed
per-login loopback listener and complete NFS option set; no Bloom process is
given root identity or broad mount capability. Live installed systemd acceptance
remains available as an additional operator validation rather than a publication
requirement.

A live Linux install must receive `BLOOM_RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY` pointing to a
separately obtained, root-owned, non-writable copy of
`bloom-release-v1.pub`. Before stopping services or writing installation
state, the installer verifies that pin against `RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY.pem`,
verifies the `bloom-release-payload-v1` signature over `SHA256SUMS`, and then
verifies every listed payload file from a private root-owned snapshot. Every
installed executable, unit, account template, and configuration template is
read from that verified snapshot. The public key is data, not another time
service or software package.

Linux binaries are shared by all enrolled logins. Digest-distinct installs use
an immutable release directory and a coordinated host-wide transaction: stop
all active enrollments, atomically switch `current`, update the release digest
in active and retained configuration, and validate active services before
committing. Active enrollments require available user session buses. Failed
activation and interrupted transactions restore the previous release. Custody,
identity material, and allocated NFS ports are preserved.

Before any unit is mutated, the transaction (`schema
bloom.linux-upgrade-transaction.2`) snapshots the installed Bloom-owned unit
templates — both ceremony sockets, the Broker and Signer service templates, the
session path, the two user service units, and the retired RPC/control socket
templates — recording explicit absence alongside bytes and modes. A rollback
stops the release set, restores that unit contract, reselects the previous
release, and rewrites release metadata before any restart; a failure at any of
those steps preserves the transaction instead of starting a Broker over
mismatched units. The rollback clears the transaction only when every enrolled
login passes the authenticated health gate. The per-login AWS KMS Signer
drop-in and its credential are not part of the snapshot: they follow the
payload of the last installation, so a KMS host that rolls back after an
upgrade with a payload lacking the KMS overlay is repaired by rerunning the
installer with that overlay.

Recovery after an interruption restores the coherent previous installation and
then lets the verified installer retry the requested release; it never
completes the interrupted candidate in place. Recovery clears the transaction
as soon as the previous installation is restored and only then restarts it,
without gating on the health check: a host whose previous release cannot start
must still be able to install the release that fixes it, and a run that stops
after recovery, or reinstalls the previous release, must not leave the other
enrolled logins stopped until a reboot. Uninstalling a login is refused while
an interrupted upgrade is pending. A
transaction recorded by an earlier installer (`schema
bloom.linux-upgrade-transaction.1`) carries no unit snapshot; it is recovered
by rolling the binary selection and release metadata back on their own, as the
installer that opened it would have, and the retried installation then rewrites
every Bloom-owned unit coherently before starting anything.

Linux installs provide `bloom-uninstall`. Its default `--retain-custody` mode
stops and disables the selected enrollment, removes runtime integration, and
preserves its private configuration and Signer state for reinstall. Permanent
purge requires `--purge` and the exact `delete-bloom-login-LOGIN_UID`
confirmation. Shared runtime files are removed only after the last active
enrollment, while the uninstaller remains available until all retained custody
has also been purged.

```sh
sudo bloom-uninstall
sudo bloom-uninstall --purge "delete-bloom-login-$(id -u)"
```

Production macOS enrollment does not accept that private fixture layout. Its
installed Machine binary generates fresh per-login Machine, Broker, Signer,
revoke-client, session, installer, audit, review, ceremony, and revocation
keys from the OS CSPRNG in a root-owned empty staging directory. It renders
only signed public templates from `installer/macos/config`, cross-pins the
public keys, signs the provenance catalog locally, atomically installs the
private outputs under their final principals, and removes the staging
directory. Bundle build and verification reject concrete private seeds and
identity-shaped JSON for a production macOS claim.

The macOS installer stages an immutable release before stopping any installed
triad. A live install first copies the candidate into a private root-owned
snapshot and authenticates and installs exclusively from that snapshot. It then
journals the old and new digests, stops every enrollment before
the shared atomic `current` switch, updates build-digest state, and validates
each installed triad before publishing all enrollments active. Failed activation
and a transaction found after interruption restore the old release, integration
files, and health. Custody and identity directories are never regenerated or
replaced during this sequence. The candidate state schemas must be at least the
installed schemas.

The macOS release remains rooted at `/usr/local/libexec/bloom`, with the
user-facing `/usr/local/bin/bloom` symlink following its atomic `current`
selector. Activation then removes the enrolled user's supported legacy
`~/.local/bin/bloom` file or symlink using that user's authority. Foreign PATH
entries fail preflight, and legacy cleanup runs only after authenticated health
has committed; users may need `hash -r`, `rehash`, or a new terminal to clear a
cached command location.

The legacy command migration does not remove old wallet data. If the resolved
login home contains `~/.bloom/keystore`, the installer prints that exact
location and a principal-bound two-command conversion for each detected v1
passkey wallet. The first command runs the packaged `bloom-signer-migrate` as
an administrator because it must read the Signer-owned configuration, stage
data in Signer's private state, and set the isolated Signer ownership. The
second `/usr/local/bin/bloom wallet migrate-passkey RECEIPT` command runs as
the login user and opens the normal Broker ceremony. Unsupported legacy wallet
kinds are identified but never modified; the staging tool supports only the
single v1 passkey format.

`uninstall --retain-custody` removes runtime integration while preserving the
exact service principals, private configuration, and custody state. `restore`
requires the exact signed retained release and publishes Machine access only
after authenticated health succeeds. Permanent purge uses the distinct
`delete-bloom-login-LOGIN_UID` confirmation and removes custody and principals.
Live configuration and identity rotation are not installer operations.
The Linux AWS KMS profile requires credentials and a non-wildcard reviewed
CIDR allowlist together; reinstall without that pair removes any prior
instance credential and egress drop-in.

The root-requiring macOS Unix-principal templates implement the production
`macos-unix-principals` profile. The optional disposable W0 lane exercises its
UID/group, filesystem, launchd, listener, network, lifecycle, and rollback
boundaries; a digest-bound conformance report is supplementary evidence, not a
required release asset. Machine and session jobs run in the `user/UID` launchd
domain, while Broker and Signer jobs run in the system domain. The rootless
code-identity architecture remains a separate future profile.
